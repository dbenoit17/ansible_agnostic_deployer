= Credentials

Users will need to set up their credentials before they can run
deployments to each cloud provider.

== Ravello Credentials

Ravello credentials are stored in `~/.ravello_login` in the following 
format:

```
<ravello username>
<hashed ravello password>
```

The script located at `ansible_agnostc_deployer/ansible/tools/set-creds` 
will create this file interactively.

== AWS Credentials
